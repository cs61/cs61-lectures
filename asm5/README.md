CS61 2020: Assembly 5
=====================

Today’s lecture will concentrate on the calling convention.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

1\. The function defined in `src/f19.cc` can be used to infer how most
function parameters and local variables are handled. Compare it with `f19.s`
and develop a theory of argument passing.

2\. The function defined in `src/f20.cc` can be used to test more complex
scenarios for function parameter and return value handling. Experiment with
it—for instance, by adding members and/or changing member types in `s1` and
`s2`. Do any results change your theory of argument passing?
