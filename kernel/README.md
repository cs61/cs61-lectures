CS 61 2021: Kernel 1
====================

Todayâ€™s lecture will introduce a version of the teaching kernel that we will
use for the kernel unit.

Start by reading [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md) and run the kernel using `make run`.
This should work in our Docker container out of the box, but if you want to
run on a Linux VM or on Mac OS X, there will be some additional build steps
required.
