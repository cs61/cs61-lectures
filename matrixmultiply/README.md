CS61 2020: Networking 8
=======================

Today’s meeting is the last lecture for CS 61 2020.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

Today’s meeting is about data representation, (to some extent) assembly, and
storage.

1. Look at `sqmatrix.hh`. This file defines a type `sqmatrix` for square
   matrixes, which are 2D arrays of numbers (in this case `double`s).

   How would you represent the contents of the matrix? What are the pros and
   cons to your representation?

2. Write code for your representation.
